# Some sorting programs that I made for the university course Datastructures and Algorithms
In this repo there are a few programs I made to learn about datastructures and algorithms.
Here is a list of some algorithms:
- Radix sort
- Stack cell
- Merge sorting

### In this course I also learned about:
- Hash table
- List array
- List two cell
- Directed list
- Tree arrays
- Queue arrays
- etc.
